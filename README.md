# PnP Starter Office 365/SharePoint Online Intranet #

### Summary ###

Intranet projects shouldnâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel every time for basic features.
This solution aims to provide the fundamentals building blocks of a common intranet solution with SharePoint Online/Office 365 using the latest web stack development tools and frameworks.
Here is what you get with this sample:
- A basic page creation experience with common layouts for static page, home page and news.
- Common intranet navigation menus like main menu, header links, footer, contextual menu and breadcrumb based on taxonomy.
- A basic translation system for multilingual sites (pages and UI).
- A search experience including results with preview.
- A mobile intranet with SharePoint Online.

This solution is implemented using:

- TypeScript (for the code structure and class definitions)
- Webpack (for application bundling and packaging)
- PnP JS Core (for REST communications with SharePoint Online)
- PnP Remote Provisining engine and PowerShell cmdlets (for SharePoint site configuration and artefacts provisioning)
- Knockout JS (for application behavior)
- Bootstrap (for mobile support)
- Office UI Fabric (for icons, fonts and styles)
- Node JS (for dependencies management with npm)

The entire solution is "site collection self-contained" to not interfer with the global tenant configuration (especially taxonomy and search configuration).

### Applies to ###
-  Office 365 Multi Tenant (MT)
-  Office 365 Dedicated (D)

### Documentation #

A blog series will come soon to explain how we did this solution in details.

Provided plan:

* Part 1: Functional overview (How to use the solution?)
 * Create pages and news
 * Translate a page to multiple languages
 * Configure the cache to improve performances

* Part 2: Technical part (How it is implemented?)
 * Frameworks and patterns used
 * ALM considerations and global solution architecture
 * Provisioning with the PnP remote provisioning engine & bundling with Webpack
 * Design an mobile considerations
 * The navigation system
 * The authoring experience
 * Multilingual features
 * The search experience 
 * Analytics with Azure

### Set up your environment ###

Before starting, you need to install some prerequisites:

- Install the last release of [PnP PowerShell cmdlets SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-PowerShell/releases).
 (We recommend to use the June 2016 Intermediate 3 version, there are some issues with the August 2016 version)
- Install Node.js on your machine https://nodejs.org/en/
- Install the 'typings' node client (`npm install typings --global`)
- Install the 'webpack' node client (`npm install webpack --global`)
- Go to the ".\App" folder and install all dependencies listed in the package.json file by running the "npm install" cmd 
- Install TypeScript typings by running the "`typings install`" cmd from the ".\App" folder.
- Check if everything is OK by running the "`webpack`" cmd from the ".\App" folder. We shouldn't any errors here (just warnings)
- Create a site collection with the publishing template. We don't manage the site collection creation process in the deployment procedure because it takes too much time with SharePoint Online.

- Download the PnP source code as ZIP from GitHub and extract it to your destination folder
- Set up your environment
- On a remote machine (basically, where PnP cmdlets are installed), start new PowerShell session as an **administrator** an call the `Deploy-Solution.ps1` script with your parameters like this:

```csharp
$UserName = "username@<your_tenant>.onmicrosoft.com"
$Password = "<your_password>"
$SiteUrl = "https://<your_tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<your_site_collection>"

Set-Location "<your_installation_folder>\PnP\O365 Starter Intranet"

$Script = ".\Deploy.ps1" 
& $Script -SiteUrl $SiteUrl -UserName $UserName -Password $Password

```
- Use the "-Prod" switch for the `Deploy-Solution.ps1` script to use a production bundled version of the code.
